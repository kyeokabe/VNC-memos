##Overview

This repository (still in the making) is a collection of end to end practical & theoretical information needed to conduct deep learning experiments. Topics range from "What components should I buy?" to "How do I do this in TensorFlow?" Note that for the most part this repository acts like a hub: it points to good information sources which helps solve problems.
