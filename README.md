##Overview

This repository (still in the making) is a collection of end to end practical & theoretical information needed to conduct deep learning experiments. Topics range from "What components should I buy?" to "How do I do this in TensorFlow?" Note that for the most part this repository acts like a hub: it points to good information sources which helps solve problems.

**[Hardware&Software](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/Hardware%26Software.md)** ...  What hardware should I buy? What software should I install?  
**[DL Resources](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/DL%20Resources.md)** ... Where can I learn deep learning?  
**[TF 2 Layer Net](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/TF_2LayerNet.md)** ... Walks through a toy program using TensorFlow and TensorBoard  
**[FarmVNC](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/FarmVNC.md)** ... describes how to make a Mac to corn VNC connection
