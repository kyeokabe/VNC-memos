##Overview

This repository (still in the making) is a collection of end to end practical & theoretical information needed to conduct deep learning experiments. Topics range from "What components should I buy?" to "How do I do this in TensorFlow?" Note that for the most part this repository acts like a directory: it points to good information sources which helps solve problems.

**[Cheat Sheet]** ... Cheat sheet that captures the essence of several DL layers
**[Hardware&Software](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/Hardware%26Software.md)** ...  What hardware should I buy? What software should I install?  
**[DL Resources](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/DL%20Resources.md)** ... Where can I learn deep learning?  
**[Softmax Python Example](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/softmax%20python%20example.md)** ... Shows how to implement *legible* forward & back prop code in python  
**[TF 2 Layer Net](https://github.com/kyeokabe/notes/blob/master/TF_2LayerNet.md)** ... Shows how to use TensorBoard with a 2 layer net toy program
