**1.4 The Curse of Dimensionality**  
  
* Not all intuitions developen in spaces of low dimensionality will generalize to spaces of high dimensionality  
* e.g. Fig. 1.22: Fraction of the volume of a sphere lying in the surface increases as dimensionality D increases  
* The dimensionality curse does not precent us from finding effective techniques qpplicable to high dimensional space  
* why? Two reasons  
* Reason 1: Real data usually is confined in a lower effective dimensionality
* Reason 2: Often in real data, small change in input variable will produce changes in the target variable  
* Succesful pattern recognition techniques exploit these two properties
